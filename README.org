** Introduction

[[https://github.com/zcaudate/eta-logger][eta-logger]] is a simple keylogging implementation based from [[https://gist.github.com/darius/bf4d3f82114a937f63bf][this gist]]. It saves all commands, line numbers and buffers to a rotating log file for later playback and extraction of statistics. It assumes that emacs is not being used to input any sensative information and only records within buffers. 

Modes can be excluded from being logged.
